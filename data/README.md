# Data

The [`multiplier/`](multiplier/) folder contains the same data generated by the [MultiPLIER project](https://github.com/greenelab/multi-plier) but separated by model matrices so they can be more easily downloaded.
Please, if you use any of these MultiPLIER files, cite the corresponding paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003).
All the files were downloaded from [this figshare archive](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5716033.v4), and later processed by the notebooks in [this folder](https://github.com/greenelab/phenoplier/tree/master/nbs/01_preprocessing).

* `clustering/cluster_lvs/`: contains the set of LVs that distinguish traits in each cluster (separated by partitions) from the rest.
This was obtained by the decision tree model.
* `crispr/analyses/`: contains the fgsea analysis on our lipids-altering gene-sets found by a CRISPR screen.
* `data_transformations/`: contains different transformations of the S-MultiXcan results (in PhenomeXcan) projected into the latent space.
These files are transformations of the ones in the `projections/` folder.
* `drug_disease_prediction/`: contains files for the drug-disease prediction.
  * `gold_standard_set/`: prediction files for using the gold standard set (PharmacotherapyDB).
Only traits and drug pairs in this set are included.
  * `phenomexcan/`: prediction files for all traits in PhenomeXcan and all drugs in LINCS L1000 separated by tissue.
In the original manuscript, for each drug-disease pair, we took the maximum score, but other strategies (like computing the mean or median) could be used.
* `gls/`: LV-trait association results (PhenomeXcan) using a generalized least squares approach similar to the gene-property analysis in MAGMA.
* `multiplier/`: MultiPLIER model files. See text above regarding citations.
In addition, this folder has the following two more end-user-friendly Excel files for a quick analysis (which were generated by [this notebook](https://github.com/greenelab/phenoplier/blob/master/nbs/99_manuscript/lvs/05-export_lv_gene_dataframe.ipynb)):
  * `lv-gene_weights.xlsx`: it contains one sheet per LV (987 in total) with the list of genes that belong to each one sorted by their weights.
If you want to access this data in a programatic way, you should check out the files `multiplier_model_z.*`, which contain the gene x LVs matrix of weights.
  * `lv-pathways.xlsx`: this is the Excel version of `multiplier_model_summary.*`, where data is sorted by LV identifier and then by FDR.
* `projections/`: contains data projected into the latent space, such as the S-MultiXcan results and S-PrediXcan (PhenomeXcan), and LINCS L1000.
