# Setup

To prepare the environment to run the PhenoPLIER code, follow the steps in [environment](environment/).
That will create a conda environment and download the necessary data.

# Running code

Once the environment is ready, you can start your JupyterLab server by running:

```bash
bash scripts/run_nbs.sh
```

Go to `http://localhost:8892` and browse the `nbs` folder. Then run notebooks in the specified order.
